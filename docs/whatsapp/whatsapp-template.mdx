## 📜 Template

You can create the template while creating an Event with Whatsapp channel
enabled. You can easily create/update the template content by editing the event.

### Template Components:

1. **Message Type** : Business initiated (Template Message) or User initiated
   (Session Message)
2. **Content Type**: Type of the whatsapp template (text / media / interactive)
3. **Template Name**: Name of the approved template
4. **Whatsapp Message**: Message text
5. **Header** (Only for Media & Interactive)
6. **Reply Buttons** (Only for Interactive)
7. **Custom Data**: Key value map that will be passed to your notification. You
   can use this to pass any additional data with the notification, like orderid,
   username etc.

### Dynamic Content

To pass dynamic or custom data in the template like invoice number, user name,
tracking link etc., you should wrap it within handlebars `{{ user_name }}`. Raven
uses [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars) to
parse the template and all handlebar operations are supported. Following
Handlebars expressions are supported within templates:

1. Nested objects
2. #if, #each, #with

You will need to pass the value of the variables in the data object of
[Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event).

**Example**

Whatsapp Template:

```json
Hey {{user_name}}, Thank you for your Order Id# {{order.id}} of amount {{order.amount}}.
{{#if premium}} Glad to have you as our Premium customer. {{/if}}
```

`data` object in API:

```json
...,
"data": {
    "user_name": "Joe",
    "order": {
        "id": 123,
        "amount": 745
    },
    "premium": true
}
```
