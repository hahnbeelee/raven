## Setup

### Step 1. Add Integration

- In the dashboard, Integrations > In-app > Raven, setup the integration by
  adding the integration name.

### Step 2. Generate a unique signature for every user

- To allow Raven to fetch the notification details for a user, Raven needs a
  unique signature for every user. This can be done by generating a hash of the
  userId signed with the Raven API Key.
- Since this signature requires Raven API key, it is highly recommended to
  create a backend API that generates the hash and sends to the frontend.
  Following example shows how to generate a **HMAC-SHA256** Signature (hash of
  your userId signed with your Raven API Key) in Java -
- Add this dependency to `pom.xml` for using **HmacUtils** to generate signature

```md pom.xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>commons-codec</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-codec</artifactId>
  <version>1.16</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.HmacUtils;

private String hmacSha256Signature(String userId, String apiKey) {
     return (new HmacUtils("HmacSHA256", apiKey.getBytes()).hmacHex(userId));
}
```

- You can generate the signature on login and pass to the SDK on initialization.
- For testing purposes, use the free
  [HMAC-SHA256 hash generator tool](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/hmac-sha256-online).
  Pass the text as the user identifier and the secret key as your Raven API key.

### Step 3. Add SDK

Add the frontend SDK that shows the notification center. Currently we support
the following SDKs:

- [In-App Angular SDK](in-app/in-app-integrations/in-app-angular-sdk)

### Step 4. Delivery Reports

Setting up Delivery Reports for In-app sent via Raven does not require any
additional step. Raven SDK automatically handles the delivery reports.
