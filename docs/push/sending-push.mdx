### Firebase Push

1. Start with creating an app and an add a Firebase integration. Then, create an
   event with push enabled. For detailed steps, please follow the
   [docs](/platform/apps/apps). If you are trying in Sandbox, then a Firebase
   integration is already in place. The sandbox account only supports web push
   on the Raven console. You can retrieve the device token by clicking the
   Firebase integration.

2. Add a push template to the event and it make it live. Please check the
   [doc](/push/push-template) on how to add a push template.

3. Once the event is setup, you can either create a user with token on Raven or
   pass the device token directly when triggering the event. Check the
   [Users doc](/platform/users) for details.

4. Trigger the event using the console or the Send Event API. Check the testing
   [doc](/push/sending-push) for details.

Once you send an event, you will see a log created in the Logs section. The
status of the notification will be updated based on the delivery, or whether the
notification is clicked or dismissed.
