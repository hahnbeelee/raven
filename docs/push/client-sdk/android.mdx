1. Manage (Create/Update) your users and their preferences on Raven.
2. Manage Push tokens on Raven.

### Setup

This setup helps you to set user and manage tokens on Raven. It assumes you
already have setup Firebase and are handling the rendering of notifications
yourself. Also, you must setup a Firebase Integration on the console and create
an event with a Push template as defined [here](/push/push-template). Once done,
please follow the below steps

1. Setup Firebase

   - [Create](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#create_a_firebase_project)
     your Firebase project.
   - [Register](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#register_your_app_with_firebase)
     your app with Firebase.
   - [Add](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#add_a_firebase_configuration_file)
     a Firebase configuration file.

2. Add the following in your project gradle:

```json
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

3. Add the following library in your app gradle. Please check the latest version
   [here](https://jitpack.io/#ravenappdev/raven-fcm-util).

```javascript
implementation 'com.github.ravenappdev:raven-android-sdk:1.0.6'
```

4. Initialize the SDK in Application onCreate.

```javascript
RavenSdk.initialize(this, YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_ACCOUNT_API_KEY);
```

5. Set user on signup/login. You can use any of the following methods to set
   user. Note that this will create a user if it does not exists in Raven. If it
   exists, it will simply update the user if there is any change.

```javascript
RavenSdk.setUserMobile(USER_ID, MOBILE);
RavenSdk.setUserEmail(USER_ID, EMAIL);
RavenSdk.setUser(USER_ID, MOBILE, EMAIL);
```

6. Set the Firebase device token on Raven.

```javascript
RavenSdk.setDeviceToken(TOKEN);
```

7. When you receive a message from Firebase in the `onMessageReceived` callback,
   please update Raven with DELIVERED status. If you have set up Notification
   click and dismiss receivers, please update Raven with CLICKED and DISMISSED
   statuses respectively. This method takes the Raven `notificationId` as an
   argument. Raven generates a unique notification id and attaches it in the
   data payload.

```javascript
val notificationId = remoteMessage.data["raven_notification_id"]

//When notification is delivered
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.DELIVERED)

//When notification is clicked
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.CLICKED)

//When notification is dismissed
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.DISMISSED)
```

7. When the user logs out of your app, we need to de-register the device token.
   Call `logout` to logout the user from Raven.

```javascript
RavenSdk.logout();
```
