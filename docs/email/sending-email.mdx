description: "Check the steps below to start sending Email with Raven using any provider."
---

1. Start with creating an app and an add your Email integration. Then, create an
   event with email enabled. For detailed steps, please follow the
   [docs](/platform/apps/apps). If you are trying in Sandbox, then a SendGrid
   email integration is already in place.

2. Add an email template to the event and make it live. Please check the
   [doc](/email-email-template) on how to add an email template.

3. Once the event is setup, you can either create a user with an email on Raven
   or pass the email directly when triggering the event. Check the
   [Users doc](/platform/users) for details.

4. Trigger the event using the console or the Send Event API. Check the
   [testing doc](/email/sending-email) for details.

Once you send an event, you will see a log created in the Logs section. The
status of the email notification will be updated based on the delivery callback
received from the provider.
