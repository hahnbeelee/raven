### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with ClickSend yet, you can easily create an accountÂ [here](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/signup/step1).

To be able to send bulk sms to your clients, as per new TRAI regulations you also need to register on the DLT platform. Follow the steps to register on DLT platform [here](https://www.notion.so/DLT-Registration-Steps-ca272ad868cc4014920a8c964ebd4294)

Once you have registered yourself on DLT and created a ClickSend account, you can then add ClickSend Integration in Raven.

<Note>
  If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their
  business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms.
