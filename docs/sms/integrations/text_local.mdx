### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with TextLocal yet, create one by signing up
[here](https://www.textlocal.com/signup/). Once you have registered yourself on
DLT and created an TextLocal account, you can then add TextLocal Integration in
Raven.

<Note>

If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business,
headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the
guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the
setup done.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

There is no additional configuration required to setup delivery reports. Raven
manages the delivery callback internally for TextLocal.

## Advanced

**Send additional parameters to TextLocal**

Raven sends the fields present in the SMS template to TextLocal by default. To
send additional fields, please check our [Override doc](/sms/sms-template).

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure Raven's IP
addresses are whitelisted and not blocked.

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
