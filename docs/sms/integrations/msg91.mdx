### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with MSG91 yet, create an account
[here](https://msg91.com/). You would need to get your MSG91 approved before
starting to send SMS. Follow the doc
[here](https://help.msg91.com/article/359-my-account-status-is-in-demo-what-can-i-do-to-make-my-account-live)
to get the account approved.

<Note>

If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business,
headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the
guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the
setup done.
