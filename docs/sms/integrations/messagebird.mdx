### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the MessageBird
   Integration, you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click
   on MessageBird SMS. You will see a URL as Status Webhook, present in the
   integration. Copy this URL.
2. Log in to MessageBird and go to
   [Delivery Reports](https://dashboard.messagebird.com/en/developers/settings).
3. Paste the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1, in the Status reports URL and
   click on Save.

## Advanced

**Send additional parameters to MessageBird**

Raven sends the fields present in the SMS template to MessageBird by default. To
send additional fields, please check our [Override doc](/sms/sms-template).

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure Raven's IP
addresses are whitelisted and not blocked.

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
