### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with 2Factor yet, you can easily create an accountÂ [here](https://2factor.in/v3/free-bulk-sms-service-trial/index.php)\*\*.

To be able to send bulk sms to your clients, as per new TRAI regulations you also need to register on the DLT platform. Follow the steps to register on DLT platform [here](https://www.notion.so/DLT-Registration-Steps-ca272ad868cc4014920a8c964ebd4294) (or 2 factor link [here](http://2factor.in/v3/dlt/trai-mandatory-dlt-registration/))

Once you have registered yourself on DLT and created a 2Factor account, you can then add 2Factor Provider in Raven.

<Note>
  If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their
  business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms.
