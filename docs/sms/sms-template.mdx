title: "SMS Template"
---

You can create an SMS template while creating an Event with SMS enabled. You can
easily create/update the template content by editing the event.

![Sample SMS Template](/images/sample-sms.png)

An SMS message is a simple plain text message. The character limit for a single
SMS message is 160 characters. When you send a SMS message over 160 characters,
the message will be split into segments of 153. For example, a 161-character
message will be sent as two messages, one with 153 characters and the second
with 8 characters. The recipient's device will then rebuild the messages and
show as one.

If you include
[non-GSM characters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding),
such as (Hindi, Greek, Korean or Arabic etc), in SMS messages, Raven will send
those messages with Unicode encoding. Such messages are limited to 70 characters
and > 70 characters will be concatenated into 67 character message segments.

<Note>
  For SMS sent in India, the templates need to be registered on any of the DLT
  platforms. You should add the registered DLT Template ID in the SMS template.

### Dynamic Content

To pass dynamic or custom data in the SMS template like invoice number, user
name, tracking link etc., you should wrap it within
[handlebars {{ user_name }}](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).
Raven uses Handlebars.js to parse the template and all handlebar operations are
supported. Following Handlebars expressions are supported within templates:

1. Nested objects
2. #if, #each, #with

You will need to pass the value of the variables in the data object of
[Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event).

**Example**

SMS Template:

```md
Hey {{user_name}}, Thank you for your Order Id #{{order.id}} of amount
{{order.amount}}. {{#if premium}} Glad to have you as our Premium customer.
{{/if}} data object in API:
```

```json
...,
"data": {
    "user_name": "Joe",
    "order": {
        "id": 123,
        "amount": 745
    },
    "premium": true
}
```

### Additional fields

Apart from the SMS text, you can also send additional fields in the template.
This is useful if you want to override the "From"/"Sender ID"/"Header" that you
configured while setting up the integration.

| Field    | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sender` | Name of the message sender (same as "From"/"Sender ID"/"Header") |

---

This is how you can pass it in the [Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event).
Check the API doc for the complete request.

```json
...,
"override" : {
    ...,
    "sms" : {
        "sender" : ""
    }
}
```
