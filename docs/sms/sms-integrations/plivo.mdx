### Step 2. MSG91 Integration in Raven

| `Auth ID`  | Plivo Auth ID. You can find it on the home screen of your [Pivlo Console](https://console.plivo.com/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/).                       |

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

There is no additional configuration required to setup delivery reports. Raven
manages the delivery callback internally for Plivo.

## Advanced

**Send additional parameters to Plivo**

Raven sends the fields present in the SMS template to Plivo by default. To send
additional fields, please check our [Override doc](/sms/sms-template).

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure Raven's IP
addresses are whitelisted and not blocked.

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
