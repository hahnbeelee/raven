### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with Gupshup yet, you will have to create an
enterprise account by contacting their support
[here](https://enterprise.smsgupshup.com/login). Once you have registered
yourself on DLT and created an Gupshup account, you can then add Gupshup
Integration in Raven.

<Note>
  If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their
  business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms.
