### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with Kaleyra yet, create an account
[here](https://developers.kaleyra.io/docs/create-an-account-in-kcloud). Kaleyra
requires you to complete its KYC and other details to get sender id and register
templates. Follow the onboarding doc
[here](https://developers.kaleyra.io/docs/onboarding_kcloud) to get the setup
done.

<Note>

If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business,
headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the
guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the
setup done.
