## ðŸ“œ Template

You can create the template while creating an Event with Slack channel enabled.
You can easily create/update the template content by editing the event.

Raven supports both text and [block-kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) format
for creating slack messages.

Here's how you can add a blocks message in the template section of the Event.

### Dynamic Content

To pass dynamic or custom data in the template like invoice number, user name,
tracking link etc., you should wrap it within handlebars `{{ user_name }}` .
Raven uses [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars)
to parse the template and all handlebar operations are supported. Following
Handlebars expressions are supported within templates:

1. Nested objects
2. #if, #each, #with

You will need to pass the value of the variables in the data object of
[Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event).

**Example**

```javascript Slack Template
Hey {{user_name}}, Thank you for your Order Id# {{order.id}} of amount {{order.amount}}.
{{#if premium}} Glad to have you as our Premium customer. {{/if}}
```

`data` object in API:

```json
...,
"data": {
    "user_name": "Joe",
    "order": {
        "id": 123,
        "amount": 745
    },
    "premium": true
}
```
